Next Steps:
  - Look into weirdness related to grant failures - only works intermittently for chad?
  - Update readme
  - Deployment/Update process
  * Demo!
    ? Medium-sized thumbnail for detail view - is this still needed with current speed?


Goals:
* Distributable - non-technical users should be able to deploy the whole app.  Suggests a single CFN template and/or AWS Marketplace.
* Hostable - Can run multiple instances in a single account
* Sorta-social - Manage permissions and users, but not a "multi-tenant" app.
* Secure - Don't lose my pictures!  Don't show 'em to yahoos!

MVP Needs:
* Storage (S3)
* Metadata store (Dynamo)
* Authn/z (Cognito)
* API tier (Lambda/Python/Chalice)
* Processing Tier (Lambda)
* Front-end (React on S3)
* App Features:
  * Storage (Managed through S3 interface or clients)
  * Galleries
  * Thumbnails
  * Tags
  * Ratings
  * Permissions (managed through Cognito interface)
    * Public
    * Shareable with/Link
    * Private
  * Metadata extraction (Date/Time at minimum)

Tasks:
Deployment model
- CFN
- 2-stage - Lambda code staged to public S3 bucket, CFN uses it
Better-organized repo
- Contain all Lambda code as separate packages/directories
- Infra code
- Tests (Ha!)
- Docs
Infra Code
- One CFN template for S3, Lambda, Dynamo, Cognito
- Dynamo GSI's
Utility Code:
- Indexing function for processing thumbnails & generating metadata
App Code (API):
- Photo GET
- Gallery CRUD operations
- Tagging & rating
- Search
Front-end:
- Gallery View
- Image View
- Search results

Backlog:
- Capital letters in stack name cause UserPoolDomain to fail
- Scroll within filter frame - "freeze" top nav and filter controls on photoflow
- Preserve last-clicked view
- Toast pop-up confirmation when copying Gallery link to clipboard
- Attribution: Delete icon by Landan Lloyd from the Noun Project
- More sophisticated tag filters - ands & ors
- Hover tagging - select from the 5 most recently applied tags
- Download link for raw file
- Group operations
- Notes per photo and per gallery
- RSS feeds for galleries
- OpSec: AWS Config, CloudWatch Alarms
- Uploads.  Agents?
- Mobile
- Multi-region support - multi-region dist buckets and CFN map
- Hover-to-zoom-by-double?  Makes it easier to rate from photoFlow
- Lightroom-style - one big image with a row of thumbnails along the bottom

Deployment Steps:
1) Deploy CFN Template
2) Deploy API Gateway to LATEST stage
2) Write variables into .env file
3) Run myf0t0/deploy.sh

Update Steps:
1) Update CFN stack
2) Deploy API Gateway to LATEST stage
3) deploy processor function from myf0t0dist bucket
4) deploy API function from myf0t0dist bucket
5) write new .env file
6) run myf0t0/deploy.sh
7) reindex all photos (conditionally)
