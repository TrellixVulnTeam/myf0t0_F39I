Next Steps:
  * Add Lambda functions (and IAM stuff) to CFN
  * Update processing code to work with DDB

Goals:
* Distributable - non-technical users should be able to deploy the whole app.  Suggests a single CFN template and/or AWS Marketplace.
* Hackable - Loosely coupled components, as few fancy frameworks as possible
* Hostable - Can run multiple instances in a single account
* Sorta-social - Manage permissions and users, but not a "multi-tennant" app.
* Secure - Don't lose my pictures!  Don't show 'em to yahoos!

MVP Needs:
* Storage (S3)
* Metadata store (Dynamo)
* Authn/z (Cognito)
* API tier (Lambda/Python/Flask)
* Processing Tier (Lambda)
* Front-end (React on S3)
* App Features:
  * Storage (Managed through S3 interface or clients)
  * Galleries
  * Thumbnails
  * Tags
  * Ratings
  * Permissions (managed through Cognito interface)
    * Public
    * Shareable with/Link
    * Private
  * Metadata extraction (Date/Time at minimum)

Tasks:
Deployment model
- CFN
- 2-stage - Lambda code staged to public S3 bucket, CFN uses it
Better-organized repo
- Contain all Lambda code as separate packages/directories
- Infra code
- Tests (Ha!)
- Docs
Infra Code
- One CFN template for S3, Lambda, Dynamo, Cognito
- Dynamo GSI's
Utility Code:
- Indexing function for processing thumbnails & generating metadata
App Code (API):
- Photo GET
- Gallery CRUD operations
- Tagging & rating
- Search
Front-end:
- Gallery View
- Image View
- Search results

Backlog:
- OpSec: AWS Config, CloudWatch Alarms
- Uploads.  Agents?
- Mobile
- Multi-region support - multi-region dist buckets and CFN map
